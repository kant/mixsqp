Description: The 'mixSQP' package provides algorithms based on
    sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for maximum likelihood
    estimation of the mixture proportions in a finite mixture model
    where the component densities are known. For large data sets
    (large sample sizes), the SQP algorithm can be orders of magnitude
    faster than a state-of-the-art interior-point solver implemented
    by function 'KWDual' in the 'REBayes' package.
