Description: Provides optimization algorithms based on sequential
  quadratic programming (SQP) for maximum likelihood estimation of the
  mixture proportions in a finite mixture model where the component
  densities are known. The SQP algorithm is expected to
  obtain solutions that are at least as accurate as the state-of-the-art
  MOSEK interior-point solver (called by function "KWDual" in
  the 'REBayes' package), and is expected to compute these
  solutions much more quickly in large data sets.
