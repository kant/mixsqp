mix-SQP: Sequential Quadratic Programming for fast maximum-likelihood
estimation of mixture proportions

We provide code implementing optimization method for
maximum-likelihood estimation of mixture proportions, including a fast
algorithm based on sequential quadratic programming, which we call
"mix-SQP".

This repository contains code resources to accompany our research
