to do
=====

* Add Travis CI and codecov.

+ Fix appveyor settings so that a commit triggers a build---try this
  on a fork of the mixSQP repo.

+ Change SQP convergence check so that it is checking only the dual
  residual for the nonzero entries of the current solution, x. Also,
  add a more informative comment to accompany this check.

+ Move the active-set code into a separate function.

+ Move the backtracking line search code into a separate function.

+ Add an error message if backtracking line search could not find a
  step size satisfying the sufficient decrease condition. Error
  message should be something like, "Step size too small; consider
  increasing..."

+ Understand where quadratic subproblem convergence criteria come
  from, and use this understanding to improve documentation.

* Ask someone (e.g., Jason) to review package and documentation.

+ Update pkgdown site.
