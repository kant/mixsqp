to do
=====

+ Run tests conditional on availability of the REBayes package.

+ Add codecov.

+ Change norm(p,2) <= convtolactiveset stopping criterion for
  active-set method. Also replace "convtolactiveset" by
  "zero.searchdir".

+ Add an error message if backtracking line search could not find a
  step size satisfying the sufficient decrease condition. Error
  message should be something like, "Step size too small; consider
  increasing..."

  likewise for the main functions).
