to do
=====

+ Change norm(p,2) <= convtolactiveset stopping criterion for
  active-set method. Also replace "convtolactiveset" by
  "zero.searchdir".

+ Add an error message if backtracking line search could not find a
  step size satisfying the sufficient decrease condition. Error
  message should be something like, "Step size too small; consider
  increasing..."

+ Reorder columns in verbose=TRUE console output for mixSQP, and in
  "data" return value.

+ Consider changing package name from "mixSQP" to "mixsqp" (and
  likewise for the main functions).

+ Ask someone (e.g., Jason) to review package and documentation.

+ Update pkgdown site.
