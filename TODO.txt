to do
=====

* Add Travis CI and codecov (I will need Youngseok's help with this).

+ Fix appveyor settings so that a commit triggers a build.

+ Complete help page for mixSQP.

+ Add note to "mixsqp" documentation about multithreaded matrix
  computations for large matrices.

* Improve console output for mixsqp when verbose = TRUE. In
  particular, print out the maximum difference between two successive
  iterations of the outer loop.

+ Improve post-processing of mixSQP output.

+ Understand where quadratic subproblem convergence criteria come
  from, and use this understanding to improve documentation.
