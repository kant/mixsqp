to do
=====

+ Add a test to make sure that the solution is the same when the
  likelihood matrix is normalized vs. unnormalized.

+ Add test for case when m = 2.

* Add Travis CI and codecov (I will need Youngseok's help with this).

* Add AppVeyor (I will need Youngseok's help with this).

+ Add test(s) for very small ("toy") data set; see REBayes package for
  some ideas.
