to do
=====

* Add Travis CI and codecov.

+ Fix appveyor settings so that a commit triggers a build---try this
  on a fork of the mixSQP repo.

+ Change SQP convergence check so that it is checking the dual
  residual only for the *nonzero entries* of the current solution,
  x. Also, add a more informative comment to accompany this check.

+ Change norm(p,2) <= convtolactiveset stopping criterion for
  active-set method. Also replace "convtolactiveset" by
  "zero.searchdir".

+ Change the b.min() >= -convtolactiveset stopping criterion so that
  it is only over co-ordinates in the working set (that is, the "zero"
  co-ordinates).

+ Fix newind = b.index_min() so that it is limited to the active
  (working) set.

+ Add an error message if backtracking line search could not find a
  step size satisfying the sufficient decrease condition. Error
  message should be something like, "Step size too small; consider
  increasing..."

+ Reorder columns in verbose=TRUE console output for mixSQP, and in
  "data" return value.

+ Consider changing package name from "mixSQP" to "mixsqp" (and
  likewise for the main functions).

+ Ask someone (e.g., Jason) to review package and documentation.

+ Update pkgdown site.
