to do
=====

+ Activate GitHub Pages (to show pkgdown site).

+ Edit description at top of GitHub page.

* Add Travis CI and codecov (I will need Youngseok's help with this).

+ Fix appveyor settings so that a commit triggers a build.

+ Complete help page for mixSQP.

+ Complete help page for mixKWDual.

+ Create a short vignette comparing performance of mixSQP against
  REBayes on a large-ish data set (working on this).

+ Add note to "mixsqp" documentation about multithreaded matrix
  computations for large matrices.

* Improve console output for mixsqp when verbose = TRUE. In
  particular, print out the maximum difference between two successive
  iterations of the outer loop.
