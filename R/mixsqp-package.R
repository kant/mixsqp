#' mixsqp: Sequential Quadratic Programming for Fast Maximum-Likelihood
#' Estimation of Mixture Proportions
#'
#' Provides optimization algorithms based on sequential quadratic
#' programming (SQP) for maximum likelihood estimation of the mixture
#' proportions in a finite mixture model where the component densities
#' are known. To learn more, visit
